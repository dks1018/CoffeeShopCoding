I need the code to open webpage scrape 1 2 or 3 phone numbers from the page then do that on 9 more pages on the same url link 

print the names and phone numbers in a dict 

reset the page number to 0 

move to the next url that is concatenated by addr_list and city_list incrementing 

and then the loop runs like that until there is no more data in the addr and city list






READ BELOW FOR MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION








outside the loop 
import selenium 

chromedriver variable 

browser variable

addr_list 
city_list 
                    Front                                           +                                        Middle  + City                  Backend + Page
front of the url = "https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/details?streetaddress"(= + addr_list data point) #&citystatezip=(city_list data point)  &rid=0x

iterate through the Page_Num = 0

define/ Addr = 0  (for concatenating)

define/ City_Zip = 0 (for concatenating)

iterate through addr_list and city_list inc = 0



inside the for loop
the addr_list and the city_list has to be stepped through starting at data point 0 on both of them until list end

both data points 0 for the addr_list and city_list need to be input into the url concatenation in the while loop 

(once the while loop has run then both data points 1 for the addr_list and city_list need to be input into the url concatenation in the while loop)




Inside the while loop
concatenate and iterate the url

Front                                           +          Address            +           Middle + City                  Backend + Page
"https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/details?streetaddress"(= + addr_list data point) #&citystatezip=(city_list data point)  &rid=0x

(the url has to use the front, addr list, city list and page number to concatenate the url) 

(the url also needs to iterate through the page number 0,1,2,3,4,ect-9) 

(then reset to 0 once it is has scraped data from page 9)

url has to be called 

webpage has to open   

only the name of the person and the fort 3 phone numbers have to be scraped off of the page 

if page has no phone numbers code needs to continue

enter name and phone numbers in dictionary, even if there is only one or two phone numbers 

record them in a dictionary 




P.S.(MUST READ)


if bot pops up when the url is changed and the loop runs again(hasn't been done yet this if you can get it to work)

then the page has to be closed and a new one opened for every new url being concatenated opened and scraped
